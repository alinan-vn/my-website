                    <h2>Hi, I'm Alejandro</h2>
                    <p>a full-stack software engineer with a solid foundation in DevOps and a deep enthusiasm for building scalable web experiences. I currently work at Walgreens, where I design and develop features for their e-commerce platform using React, Redux, and Spring Boot. I'm passionate about clean code, intuitive user interfaces, and robust testing, from unit tests in Jest to full E2E coverage with Playwright. Whether I'm integrating payment flows, optimizing UI performance, or mentoring interns, I thrive in collaborative teams that care about quality and innovation.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not building software, you'll find me composing music, getting lost in a good book, chasing miles on a run, or scaling walls at the climbing gym.</p>

                    <h3>üéì Education</h3>
                    <p>I originally studied Aerospace Engineering with a focus on rocket science, but later pivoted to software development, learning full-stack engineering in a React/Rails stack at Flatiron School. Down the road, I hope to explore Operating System design or dive into Cybersecurity as part of my career growth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>üíº Experience</h3>
                    <p>After graduating from Flatiron School, I co-founded a small startup with fellow alumni, focusing on UX/UI design consulting. Following a brief tenure there, I spent two years at USAA as a Software Engineer, working on everything from database management to maintaining legacy systems. I then joined Walgreens as a DevOps Engineer and soon transitioned into a Full-Stack role, where I currently contribute to several of their e-commerce website services.</p>

                    <h3>üéØ Goals</h3>
                    <p>My overarching goal is to make a meaningful, positive impact on the world through my work and actions. I envision spending the next 15 years in the private sector, followed by a decade or more in nonprofit or government service, and eventually dedicating myself to supporting my local community through teaching.</p><br />
                    <p>Professionally, I aim to master my current responsibilities as a full-stack engineer, then delve deeper into the technical side of software by exploring operating system design or cybersecurity.</p>

                        <p>At Walgreens, I've contributed in multiple capacities. I initially joined as a DevOps Engineer, working with Azure and Kubernetes, but transitioned after six months into a Full-Stack role with a focus on frontend development using React and Spring. I've worked across nearly every stage of the e-commerce experience‚Äîfrom search and product discovery to checkout, payment, and order history. Notably, I implemented the current PayPal payment option on the frontend and led a comprehensive end-to-end testing initiative using Playwright.</p>
